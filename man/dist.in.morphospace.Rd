\title{Calculating distances in morphospace.}
\usage{
dist.in.morphospace(y, correct = TRUE, iter = 10000)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{a paleoTS object}

\item{correct}{logical, if TRUE, distances between population means are corrected for sampling variance.}

\item{iter}{number of iterations in the parametric bootstrap; default is 1000.}
}
\value{
distances in morphospace between sample means in time series.
}
\description{
This function calculates the distances in morphospace between sample means in a time series.
This function is used by other functions and will generally not be used directly by users.
